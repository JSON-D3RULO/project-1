## Description
Shaker is a web app for discovering new cocktails and drinks. Users can *The Cocktail DB* api for a random list of cocktails filtering by alcohol type and number of drinks. Drink cards display a name and photo of the drink as well as ingredients, measurements, and recipe instructions. Favorite drinks can be stored in localStorage, recalled for future use and deleted is necessary. Shaker also features the Google maps api, allow users to pull up a map of bars near them that may be serving the new and interesting cocktails they find!

**Challenges**  
Some of the our biggest challenges on this project included the styling and alignment of the drink cards, integration of Google Maps within the Materialize modal component, and tailoring back-end api queries based on user input.

**v0.4.0** 
* NEW - The app is now called *Shaker*!
* NEW - Google maps modal that shows bars near the user
* IMPROVEMENT - Saved drinks list is restyled and includes delete button for each drink
* IMPROVEMENT - Search form and modal collapse/close upon displaying drinks

**Future Versions**
* Checkbox or switch that allows user to only search non-alcoholic drinks
* Filtering so that users don't see saved drinks in searches
* Use Materialize.css + button on drink card for saving drinks
* Use modal to check if user is 21 or older
* Expand list of ingredients to search from
* Add search category for drink types
